            Currently looking to join a team as a junior front end developer.
            This will be my first tech job. I have spent nearly 20 years working
            in the home building and remodeling industry, filling whatever role
            was needed of me. My main focus was assisting the clients with
            selecting their finishes and designing cabinet layouts. This job
            included managing the clinets expectations in terms of what was
            feasilbe, given the project design, timeline, and budget. Then
            communicating the clinets wants and needs to the project manager and
            sub contractors who were implenting the design.
          </p>
          <p class="about-aside-content">
            In my journey into the tech world I am most interested in inclusive
            design. It's important that everyone has access to technology and
            that goes beyond just an internet connection. The designs of web
            sites need to be set up so that everyone feels included regardless of
            their hearing or seeing ability, gender idenity, and sexual
            orientation. I have been studing through Bloc and Team Treehouse.
