        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          Currently looking to join a team as a junior front end developer. This
          will be my first tech job. I have spent nearly 20 years working in the
          home building and remodeling industry, filling whatever role was
          needed of me. My main focus was assisting the clients with selecting
          their finishes and designing cabinet layouts. This job included
          managing the clinets expectations in terms of what was feasilbe, given
          the project design, timeline, and budget. Then communicating the
          clinets wants and needs to the project manager and sub contractors who
          were implenting the design.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my journey into the tech world I am most interested in inclusive
          design. It's important that everyone has access to technology and that
          goes beyond just an internet connection. The designs of web sites need
          to be set up so that everyone feels included regardless of their
          hearing or seeing ability, gender idenity, and sexual orientation. I
          have been studing through Bloc and Team Treehouse.
